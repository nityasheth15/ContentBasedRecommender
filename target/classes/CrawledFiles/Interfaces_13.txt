Interfaces - Wikibooks, open books for an open worldDefining classes Inheritance Interfaces Overloading methods and constructors Object Lifecycle Scope Nested classes Generics
A field is always a constant: it is always public, static and final, even if you do not mention it. A method must be public and abstract, but it is not required to write the public and abstract keywords. Constructors are forbidden.
Checked exceptions should not be declared on implementation methods other than the ones declared by the interface method or subclasses of those declared by the interface method. The signature of the interface method and the same return type or subtype should be maintained when implementing the methods. All the methods of the interface need to be defined in the class, unless the class that implements the interface is abstract.
