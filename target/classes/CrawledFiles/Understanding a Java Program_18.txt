If the code is written like this:
...it means something completely different: it declares a method which has the return type privatestaticint It is unlikely that this type exists and the method is no longer static, so the above would result in a semantic error.
Java ignores all whitespace in front of a statement. As this, these two code snippets are identical for the compiler:
However, the first one's style (with whitespace) is preferred, as the readability is higher. The method body is easier to distinguish from the head, even at a higher reading speed.
