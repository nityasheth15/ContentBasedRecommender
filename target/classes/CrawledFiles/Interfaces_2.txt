A class can implement several interface, separated by a comma. Java interfaces behave much like the concept of the Objective-C protocol. It is recommended to name an interface <verb>able, to mean the type of action this interface would enable on a class. However, it is not recommended to start the name of an interface by I as in C++. It is useless. Your IDE will help you instead.
If you have objects from different classes that do not have common superclasses, you can't call a same method on them, even if the two classes implement a method with the same signature.
The solution is to write an interface that defines the method that should be implemented in the two classes as the SimpleInterface in the Code listing 4.14 and then the both class implement the interface as in the Code listing 4.15.
You can also have this interest using a common super class but a class can only inherit from one super class whereas it can implement several interfaces. Java does not support full orthogonal multiple inheritance. Java does not allow you to create a subclass from two classes. Multiple inheritance in C++ has complicated rules to disambiguate fields and methods inherited from multiple superclasses and types inherited multiple times. By separating interface from implementation, interfaces offer much of the benefit of multiple inheritance with less complexity and ambiguity. The price of no multiple inheritance is some code redundancy; since interfaces only define the signature of a class but cannot contain any implementation, every class inheriting an interface must provide the implementation of the defined methods, unlike in pure multiple inheritance, where the implementation is also inherited. The major benefit of that is that all Java objects can have a common ancestor. That class is called Object. When overriding methods defined in interfaces there are several rules to be followed:
