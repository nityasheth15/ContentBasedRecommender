Note: Fields are called different things in different languages. They may be called state identifiers, properties or member variables in other programming language syntax. Java uses the words fields and properties in different contexts, as would be understood from upcoming sections.Figure 3: In order to denote the Animal object as a system within the Java Environment, you present it as such. Note how fields are presented.Animal animal1 = new Animal();
Animal animal2 = new Animal();

animal1.name = "dog";
animal1.legs = 4;

animal2.name = "duck";
animal2.legs = 2;
