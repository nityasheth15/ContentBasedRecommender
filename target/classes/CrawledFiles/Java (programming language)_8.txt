Unlike C++, Java does not support operator overloading[42] or multiple inheritance for classes, though multiple inheritance is supported for interfaces.[43] This simplifies the language and aids in preventing potential errors and anti-pattern design.

There are three different styles of comments: a single line style marked with two slashes (//), a multiple line style opened with /* and closed with */, and the Javadoc commenting style opened with /** and closed with */. The Javadoc style of commenting allows the user to run the Javadoc executable to create documentation for the program.

The traditional "Hello, world!" program can be written in Java as:[44]
