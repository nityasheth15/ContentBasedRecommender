This instantiation is brought about by one of the class's methods, called a constructor. As its name implies, a constructor builds the object based on the blueprint. Behind the scenes, this means that computer memory is being allocated for the instance, and values are being assigned to the data members.
In general there are four constructor types: default, non-default, copy, and cloning.
A default constructor will build the most basic instance. Generally, this means assigning all the fields values like null, zero, or an empty string. Nothing would stop you, however, from your default sports car color from being red, but this is generally bad programming style. Another programmer would be confused if your basic car came out red instead of say, colorless.
A non-default constructor is designed to create an object instance with prescribed values for most, if not all, of the object's fields. The car is red, goes from 0-60 in 12 seconds, tops out at 190mph, etc.
