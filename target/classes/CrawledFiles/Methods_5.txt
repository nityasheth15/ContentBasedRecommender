The name has changed because the method has changed the object itself and not the reference. Now take a look at the other example:
The name has not changed because the method has changed the reference and not the object itself. The behavior is the same as if the method was in-lined and the parameters were assigned to new variable names:

Less formally, these parameters are called varargs[1]. The last parameter can be followed with ..., and Java will box all the arguments into an array. Vararg parameter must always be the last method parameter:
