For an example, we'll take an array of Strings denoting days in a week and traverse through the collection, examining one item at a time.
Notice that the loop automatically exits after the last item in the collection has been examined in the statement block.
Although the enhanced for loop can make code much clearer, it can't be used in some common situations.
At times, you would like to re-iterate a loop without executing the remaining statement within the loop. The continue statement causes the loop to re-iterate and start over from the top most statement inside the loop.
