Beware if you loop on an array or a collection in a for each loop.
If the object is null, it does not just do zero loops, it throws a null pointer exception. So don't forget this case. Add an if statement or return empty collections:
There is tools like FindBugs that parse your code and warn you about potential bugs. Most of the time, it detects possible null pointers.
