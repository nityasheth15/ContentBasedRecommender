A copy constructor is not included in the Java language, however one can easily create a constructor that do the same as a copy constructor. It's important to understand what it is. As the name implies, a copy constructor creates a new instance to be a duplicate of an already existing one. In Java, this can be also accomplished by creating the instance with the default constructor, and then using the assignment operator to equivocate them. This is not possible in all languages though, so just keep the terminology under your belt.
Java has the concepts of cloning object, and the end results are similar to copy constructor. Cloning an object is faster than creation with the new keyword, because all the object memory is copied at once to destination cloned object. This is possible by implementing the Cloneable interface, which allows the method Object.clone() to perform a field-by-field copy.
When an object is created, a reference to the object is also created. The object can not be accessed directly in Java, only through this object reference. This object reference has a type assigned to it. We need this type when passing the object reference to a method as a parameter. Java does strong type checking.
Type is basically a list of features/operations, that can be performed through that object reference. The object reference type is basically a contract that guarantees that those operations will be there at run time.
