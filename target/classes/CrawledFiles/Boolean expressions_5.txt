Code section 3.37: Comparisons. 
1 int a = 5, b = 3;
2 System.out.println(a > b); // Value is true because a is greater than b
3 System.out.println(a == b); // Value is false because a does not equal b
4 System.out.println(a != b); // Value is true because a does not equal b
5 System.out.println(b <= a); // Value is true because b is less than aOutput for code section 3.37

trueSpecifically, the == and != operators test whether both variables point to the same object. Objects will be covered later in the tutorial, in the "Classes, Objects, and Types" module.
