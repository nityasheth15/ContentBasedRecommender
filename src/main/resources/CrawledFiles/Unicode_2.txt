Unicode escape sequences consist of
Such sequences represent the UTF-16 encoding of a Unicode character. For example, 'a' is equivalent to '\u0061'. This escape method does not support characters beyond U+FFFF or you have to make use of surrogate pairs.[1]
Any and all characters in a program may be expressed in Unicode escape characters, but such programs are not very readable, except by the Java compiler - in addition, they are not very compact.
One can find a full list of the characters here.
