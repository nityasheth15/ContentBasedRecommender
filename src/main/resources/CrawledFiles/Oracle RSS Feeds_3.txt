Oracle RSS Feeds  Content Area RSS Feeds Rather than visiting a series of Web pages every day, many Web users are installing RSS newsreaders and configuring them to pull RSS feeds. It's like having news delivered to your desktop! Already set up for RSS? Configure your RSS newsreader software to point to the URL(s) below. What is RSS? As defined by Wikipedia, RSS (acronymic for Really Simple Syndication) is "a group of XML based web-content distribution and republication (Web syndication) formats primarily used by news sites and weblogs (blogs)." Essentially, an RSS feed is a hosted XML file from which your RSS newsreader pulls headlines, URLs, and other content as it is updated. Need RSS software? To get started, you'll need to download and install a free RSS newsreader client. Many are available (some as browser extensions); see the Open Directory Project's list. Point your software to RSS feeds of interest, and you're done!
