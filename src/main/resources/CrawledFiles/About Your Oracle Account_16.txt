How do I reset my password? Use the 'Forgot Password' link to reset your account password. You will then receive an email with instructions. Please click on the URL in the email and enter a new password on the screen.
What if I don't receive emails after using 'Lost Password' and 'Lost Username' Links? Wait at least 10 minutes to see if the emails arrive, or check the spam folder in your email. If you still haven't received the emails you can trigger them again, or create a new account using the same email address.
The 'Forgot Password' link indicates a password has been emailed, but I never received it. There could be several reasons why you might not have received the password reset email.
1) Old Email address–Is the account you are trying to log in with still tied to a valid email address? If you are attempting to log in with a username that’s not in e-mail format (ex: jsmith), the email address we have on file for that account may be out of date.  You will need to submit a help request to resolve this issue. 2) Email spam filtering - If we have your current email address, and you are still not receiving the password reset email, check to make sure that you are not filtering out Oracle emails through your email's spam filter.  You will want to add Oracle to your address book so that the email client doesn’t filter out account information you need or have subscribed to.
