What if I can't remember my username? Use the 'Forgot Username' link to get your username. You will receive an email with your username.
What if I’m getting an ‘Invalid Username’ error message? Check that the username and password you are attempting to log in with are correct. To make sure you are using the correct username and password, use the 'Forgot Username' link and the 'Forgot Password' link.
What if I have a username that’s not my email address? Oracle has standardized on the use of email address as username. If you have an older account where your username is not the same as your email address, you will need to log in, and then click on the "Edit" link next to username/emailaddress and update.
For example, if your current username is 'John,' then log in with that same username. If you have forgotten your password, use the same user name 'John' to receive the reset password email. The reset password email will be delivered to the email address currently associated with that account.
