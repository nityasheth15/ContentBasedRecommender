For compilation, the file must be in the right directory structure. A file containing a class in the unnamed package must be in the current/root directory; if the class belongs to a package, it must be in a directory with the same name as the package.
The convention is that package names and directory names corresponding to the package consist of only lower case letters.
A class with this package declaration
has to be in a directory named example.
