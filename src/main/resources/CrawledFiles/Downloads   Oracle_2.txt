All software downloads are free, and most come with a developer license that allows you to use full versions of the products at no charge while developing and prototyping your applications, or for strictly self-educational purposes. (Unless otherwise specified, our technical support organization will not provide technical support, phone support, or updates to you for the programs licensed under this agreement.) You can buy products with full-use licenses at any time from the online Oracle Store or from your sales representative.
