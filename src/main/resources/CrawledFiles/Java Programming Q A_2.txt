CORBA is language independent "Remote Method Invocation" like RMI. RMI only works with Java, CORBA can be used with any languages. For more information see: w:Common Object Request Broker Architecture.
RMI is much simpler to use than CORBA, so in an only Java environment RMI should be used.
If you need to call methods between different language environments, use CORBA. With CORBA a Java client can call C++ server and/or a C++ client can call a Java server. With RMI that can not be done.
The Vector class can receive any object (so it can not receive primitive types), even different types of data in the same Vector.
