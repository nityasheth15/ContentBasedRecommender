Note that after the assignment to result its value will not be changed if we assign different values to firstNumber or secondNumber, like in line 4.
With the information you have just attained, you can actually write a decent Java program that can sum up values.
An assertion checks if a condition is true:
Each assert statement is ended by a semi-colon (;). However, assertions are disabled by default, so you must run the program with the -ea argument in order for assertions to be enabled (java -ea [name of compiled program]).
