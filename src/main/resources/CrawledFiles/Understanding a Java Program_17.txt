Line separators are special whitespace characters in that they also terminate line comments, whereas normal whitespace does not.
Other Unicode space characters, including vertical tab, are not allowed as whitespace in Java.
Look at the static method intValue:
Whitespace is required between private and static, between static and int, between int and intValue, and between String and data.
