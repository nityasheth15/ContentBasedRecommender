The finalize method should always be declared protected to prevent other classes from calling the finalize method.
The java.lang.Object.getClass() method returns the java.lang.Class object for the class that was used to instantiate the object. The class object is the base class of reflection in Java. Additional reflection support is provided in the java.lang.reflect package.
The java.lang.Object.hashCode() method returns an integer (int). This integer can be used to distinguish objects although not completely. It quickly separates most of the objects and those with the same hash code are separated later in another way. It is used by the classes that provide associative arrays, for instance, those that implement the java.util.Map interface . They use the hash code to store the object in the associative array. A good hashCode implementation will return a hash code:
The second point means that two different objects can have the same hash code so two objects with the same hash code are not necessarily the same!
