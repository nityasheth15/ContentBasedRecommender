About Your Oracle AccountAn Oracle Account provides access to content, services, and applications across Oracle's various online resources.
Why do I need an Oracle Account? While much of the content and most services on Oracle.com do not require a login, Oracle has certain communities, events, and services that require users to provide some basic information in order to participate in events or forums, or to download or access select content.
Why should I provide my information? Your Oracle Account enables access to more of Oracle's collateral, content, and services. It also provides a channel for telling us what topics, products, and communities you're interested in, and a way to manage your email contact preferences.
What does an Oracle Account give me access to? At a minimum, your account gives you the ability to register for online and in-person events, product information, and online communities. Oracle Account is a simple way for you to specify topic or product interest via the Subscription Center. Additionally, depending on your interest or whether or not you have contracted services, your account may also give you access to select Oracle Services (see table below).
