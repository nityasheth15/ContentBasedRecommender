This is equivalent to the following code fragment:
The switch conditional statement is basically a shorthand version of writing many if...else statements. The switch block evaluates a char, byte, short, or int (or enum, starting in J2SE 5.0; or String, starting in J2SE 7.0), and, based on the value provided, jumps to a specific case within the switch block and executes code until the break command is encountered or the end of the block. If the switch value does not match any of the case values, execution will jump to the optional default case.
The structure of a switch statement is as follows:
If a case does not end with the break statement, then the next case will be checked, otherwise the execution will jump to the end of the switch statement.
