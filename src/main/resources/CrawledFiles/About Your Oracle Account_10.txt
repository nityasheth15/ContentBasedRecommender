I have an Oracle Account—how do I unsubscribe from receiving Oracle email communication? If you wish to unsubscribe from one or more Oracle subscriptions you previously opted-in to, log in to your account and de-select the subscription(s) that are selected. You will be removed immediately from the distribution list for those topics.
