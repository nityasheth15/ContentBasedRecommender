If only one statement is to be executed after an if block, it does not have to be enclosed in curly braces. For example, if (i == 0) i = 1; is a perfectly valid portion of Java code. This works for most control structures, such as else and while. However Oracle's Java Code Conventions explicitly state that the braces should always be used.if (boolean expression1) { statement1 statement2 ... statementn } else { statement1bis statement2bis ... statementnbis }if (boolean expression1) { statement1.1 statement1.2 ... statementn } else if (boolean expression2) { statement2.1 statement2.2 ... statement2.n } else { statement3.1 statement3.2 ... statement3.n }
