Java programs often contain non-code files such as images and properties files. These are referred to generally as resources and stored in directories local to the classes in which they're used. For example, if the class com.example.ExampleApp uses the icon.png file, this file could be stored as /com/example/resources/icon.png. These resources present a problem when a program is complied, because javac does not copy them to wherever the .class files are being complied to (see above); it is up to the programmer to move the resource files and directories.
The Java source file name must be the same as the public class name that the file contains. There can be only one public class defined per file. The Java class name is case sensitive, as is the source file name.
The naming convention for the class name is for it to start with a capital letter.
