Account Verification
When creating an Oracle Account, an email verification will be sent to the email address with which you registered. You will be asked to click on the link included in the email to confirm that you are the owner of the account. Once you've done so, a "verified" status will appear on your account profile page. Please note that you have five (5) days from the time of account creation to verify your email account. If five days have elapsed, you will need to log in to the account and click the "verify account" link in order to generate another verification email. The verification may be required by Oracle Websites and services such as My Oracle Support, OPN, OLN, and various others before you are able to continue with registration for access to those sites or services.
Oracle takes your email preferences seriously. We request that you specify your preference to receive or not receive email communications from Oracle related to our products and services based on your identified interests.
