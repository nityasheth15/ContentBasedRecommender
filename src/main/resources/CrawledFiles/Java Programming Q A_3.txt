The Vector and Hashtable classes are legacy classes that come from the 1.0 version of Java and have enforced synchronized methods resulting in performance issues on systems that does not require this characteristic. Additional classes were added at 1.2, those are ArrayList and HashMap, without synchronization. Both syncronized and not syncronized versions are implementing the List and Map interfaces, respectivelly.
Since Java 1.5, there is Generics, which allows you to specify that you want a container, like an ArrayList, to contain only certain types of things. This allows you to guarantee that what you are getting out of the container is a certain type at compile time, without explicitly casting it. This is safer (you avoid cast errors at run time) and makes your code more readable and understandable. You should use generics whenever possible.
Java applications can be run in the same way as any other program if they are found in .JAR or .JNLP packages. If you are trying to run a .class file, simply open a command line prompt and type java MyClass, where MyClass is the name of the class file you are trying to launch.
The Java String class provides substring() methods that should provide what you need. For example, mid(str, a, b) in Visual Basic would be something like str.substring(a, a+b).
