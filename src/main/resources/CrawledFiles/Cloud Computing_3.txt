Private cloud deployment is booming, as companies see the benefits of faster provisioning, on demand access, and scalability. Cloud builders can help their IT department become agile, cost-efficient private cloud providers. They view cloud from a lifecycle management perspective, from resource management and monitoring to capacity planning and chargeback mechanisms.
For this group, moving development and testing environments to PaaS platforms allows them to cut significant time from the development cycle by removing management tasks, cutting complexity, and increasing developer productivity.
The key then is to build a cloud strategy that helps every group define not only what cloud computing means to them, but also how to best use it.
The best use might be to build a cloud behind your firewall. Or it could be to subscribe to cloud applications and compute services from a trusted cloud vendor. Another option is to use infrastructure or application that is dedicated to your organization but hosted by a vendor or a local partner.
