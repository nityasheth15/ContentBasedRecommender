Android also does not provide the full Java SE standard library, although the Android class library does include an independent implementation of a large subset of it. This led to a legal dispute between Oracle and Google. On May 7, 2012, a San Francisco jury found that if APIs could be copyrighted, then Google had infringed Oracle's copyrights by the use of Java in Android devices.[52] District Judge William Haskell Alsup ruled on May 31, 2012, that APIs cannot be copyrighted,[53] but this was reversed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in May 2014.[54][55][56]
The Java Class Library is the standard library, developed to support application development in Java. It is controlled by Sun Microsystems in cooperation with others through the Java Community Process program. Companies or individuals participating in this process can influence the design and development of the APIs. This process has been a subject of controversy.[when?] The class library contains features such as:
Javadoc is a comprehensive documentation system, created by Sun Microsystems, used by many Java developers[by whom?]. It provides developers with an organized system for documenting their code. Javadoc comments have an extra asterisk at the beginning, i.e. the delimiters are /** and */, whereas the normal multi-line comments in Java are set off with the delimiters /* and */.[60]
Sun has defined and supports four editions of Java targeting different application environments and segmented many of its APIs so that they belong to one of the platforms. The platforms are:
